Documentation has been written by Bad_Ad84 (Retro Gamer Stuff Limited) and/or converted from borti4938's original documentation into markdown for easier editing and submitting contributions.

This is currently a work in progress and seeks to simplify the documentation by splitting out the different RGB boards and configurations into their own installation document.
