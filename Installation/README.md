Documentation has been written by Bad_Ad84 (Retro Gamer Stuff Limited) and/or converted from borti4938's original documentation into markdown for easier editing and submitting contributions.

This is currently a work in progress and seeks to simplify the documentation by splitting out the different RGB boards and configurations into their own installation document.

If you have any improvements, please fork, modify and submit a pull request
